using your final example with textblob, the number of negative samples textblob identifies is only 2072 out of a total of 5332., Python is my new gf., Python is my new gf., 
Am I missing here something?, Hi at time 7:09 when you mention positive and negative accuracy, That actually should be precision.,

Also, it's obvious TextBlob is "slightly better", since your condition for counting a sentence as valid is that it should have (for positive accuracy) a polarity greater or equal to 0.0001., How is this logic even working?,
