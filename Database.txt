Hey, so you definitely have a lot more experience with this than I do. When using your methods to make Vader Sentiment more accurate along with Text Blob while using the sample texts provided, I keep running into major accuracy issues. For example,  on the negative text file, both Vader and Text Blob end up classifying the text as roughly 50/50 positive and negative, which is no better than flipping a coin. Do you know why this might be?

Hi, Line 22 of the code where we are comparing the polarity to a factor.  Should it be - 0.1 instead of + 0.1?  Just a thought.

Hi at time 7:09 when you mention positive and negative accuracy, That actually should be precision.

Also, it's obvious TextBlob is "slightly better", since your condition for counting a sentence as valid is that it should have (for positive accuracy) a polarity greater or equal to 0.0001. It's then obvious that any sentence that passes that test will have a polarity greater than 0. You are counting them twice. You will always get 100% accuracy.

Hi! Thank you for this video. I have a question about the compound scores. The VADERSentiment documentation states that the threshold is >0.05, <-0.05 for positive and negative. 
positive sentiment: compound score >= 0.05
neutral sentiment: (compound score > -0.05) and (compound score < 0.05)
negative sentiment: compound score <= -0.05
Am I missing here something?

in the later textblob analysis (19:17 onwards) you did a dumb. you only took the sample with polarity of greater than 0.5 and then asked then if the polarity was greater than 0 and of course it was, since 0.5 > 0 and > is transitive. of course you were getting 100% "accuracy", but thats cheating. of course you classify correctly on those samples where you classifiy correctly.

Thanks, it is very useful. Could I ask - do I need to define:
 for line in f.read().split('\n'):
        analysis = TextBlob(line)
        if analysis.sentiment.polarity <= -0.001:
            if analysis.sentiment.polarity <= 0:
                neg_correct += 1
            neg_count +=1

If i  want to analyze random reviews or just go ahead with 
from textblob import TextBlob


analysis = TextBlob("text")

why here you can leave a = sign?  in this case there will be pos = neg and both are less than 0.1, which can not be treated as neg, and therefore increase the counter

Big fan of your work sentdex, I'm a Master's degree student in NLP (about that, your series on NLTK was very useful). and it's always a pleasure to learn from your videos. Currently I'm very interested in words embedding, will you make a video or a series about word embedding, word2vec, etc ?

using your final example with textblob, the number of negative samples textblob identifies is only 2072 out of a total of 5332. If we use the negative.txt file to actually test for positive sentiment instead, we get 2345 which is higher than negative. So, textblob is actually saying that our negative sentiment file contains MORE positive sentiment than negative sentiment lol, which is entirely wrong for our case. Is there a better way of representing negative sentiment? Because if we were to go in blind not knowing our dataset contains negative sentiment, we would actually end up with polarity leaning towards the positive end. (first time doing sentiment analysis so trying to wrap my head around this aha)

You made a mistake when using textblob the second time, which is why you kept getting 100% accuracy; it should not be 100% accuracy.

It would be interesting to see a comparison with a dataset of tweets or  Reddit comments. VADER claims it's "specifically attuned to sentiments expressed in social media".  Emoticons, slang, all caps,  initialisms, acronyms, etc.

You are making the assumption that every single line in the text you're analyzing is positive or negative, respectively. A review can be a mix of positive, neutral, and negative statements. As such, your accuracy metrics are irrelevant.

Thanks for the comparison. 

I have used Textblob on call centre data and thought it was ok, but wondered if there were alternatives.  I had never heard of Vader, only NLTK.  Given Textblob's ability to do sentiment analysis, text classification and tokenisation I think I'll stick to the Blob.  BTW it is interesting to use MatplotLib to scatter chart out sentiment vs polarity to see how your test data looks.

The one where you get 100% accuracy, you are considering the polarity either to be negative or  positive and checking the same in the next statement. if x < -0.001 then it is definitely less than 0 and if x > 0.0001 then it is clearly greater than 0. How is this logic even working? I am lost in this. Can you explain it clearly ?
